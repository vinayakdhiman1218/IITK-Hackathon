# Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon (KDSH) – Track A

> **Task:** Verify whether a character backstory claim is logically and causally consistent with long-form literary narratives.

This repository presents a retrieval-based semantic consistency solution for **Track A of the Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon (KDSH)**, addressing global consistency challenges in long novels such as *The Count of Monte Cristo* and *In Search of the Castaways*.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Large Language Models often fail to maintain global narrative consistency over long texts.  
This challenge reframes narrative understanding as a **binary classification problem**.

### Input
- Character name  
- Backstory / claim  
- Source novel  

### Output
- `1` → Consistent  
- `0` → Inconsistent  

**Key Challenge:** Relevant evidence is sparsely distributed across long documents, requiring effective retrieval rather than full-context generation.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

We adopt an evidence-grounded retrieval pipeline:

1. **Text Chunking**  
   Novels are split into overlapping chunks (~800 characters) to ensure dense, localized context.

2. **Data Ingestion (Pathway – Mandatory)**  
   Structured ingestion of text chunks and claims using the Pathway framework.

3. **Semantic Embeddings**  
   - Model: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384-dimensional)  
   - Claim embedding = Character + Backstory  
   - Corpus = novel text chunks  

4. **Similarity-Based Reasoning**  
   Cosine similarity is computed between claims and all chunks, selecting the best-matching evidence.

5. **Decision Rule (Validated Threshold)**  
   - Similarity > 0.45 → Consistent (1)  
   - Similarity ≤ 0.45 → Inconsistent (0)

## ▶️ Quick Start

Install dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the solution  
```bash
python final.py
```

**Output:**  
Generates `results.csv` containing binary consistency predictions.

## 🧪 Core Insight

Consistent claims exhibit strong semantic alignment with at least one specific passage in the novel.  
Inconsistent claims lack sufficient semantic evidence or contradict the narrative.
